# Contributing to VAE Project

We welcome contributions to this Variational Autoencoder project! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vae-project.git
   cd vae-project
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîß Development Setup

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints where possible
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep line length under 100 characters

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test with multiple datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update docstrings when modifying functions

## üìù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
1. Check if the bug has already been reported in Issues
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)
   - Error messages and stack traces

### Suggesting Features
1. Check existing issues for similar suggestions
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the feature
   - Use case and motivation
   - Possible implementation approach

### Code Contributions

#### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` for new features
- `bugfix/description` for bug fixes
- `docs/description` for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` for code refactoring

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new visualization feature`
- `fix: resolve training instability issue`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `refactor: improve model architecture`

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset mnist --epochs 5  # Quick test
   streamlit run app.py  # Test UI
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Test results
